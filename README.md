# Rockfetch

A fetch script for completely aestethic purposes.

# Configure
The configurations happens at compile time, simply edit the file:
`.cargo/config.toml`

# Compile
* Install Cargo and Rust (at least `1.58.0`). The preferred way to do so is trough [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
* Execute `cargo build --release`
* You will find the built executable in `target/release/`. Feel free to strip it with `strip target/release/rockfetch`
